        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.
        
        Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet - that title belongs to Venus. Mercury's surface temperature varies diurnally more than any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day at the equator.
        
        Mercury has no atmosphere to retain heat, leading to these extreme temperature variations. It has a rocky body like that of Earth, with a similar density, the highest of all the planets. It has a large metallic core, making up about 60% of its volume.

        detailedInfo: """
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.

        Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium comprises one quarter of its mass and one tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface.

        The ongoing contraction of its interior generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries.

        A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been observed since at least 1831.
